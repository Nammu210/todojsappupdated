        content.textContent = 'Welcome to Elevation academy';

  <body>
    <p id="content">Hello world</p>
    <button onclick="replaceText()">Replace Text</button>
  </body>
</html>
In this example, we have a p element with an id of content that initially contains the text "Hello world". 
We also have a button element that has an onclick attribute set to call the replaceText function when clicked.

The replaceText function uses the getElementById method to select the content element and 
then sets its textContent property to "Welcome to Elevation academy".
 This replaces the original text with the new text.

When the button is clicked, it calls the replaceText function, which changes the text on the page.
